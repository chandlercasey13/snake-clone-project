# Worm Game written in Javascript

## A snake clone that uses a worm in the dirt instead of a snake. I chose to make this game because I used to play it in school, and wanted to challenge my coding abilities.

**Getting Started:** 
Visit this link!
```

```


Use the arrows keys to control the worm and grow by eating the apples! See how high you can go!



Here's the link to the dirt texture I used from OpenGameArt!

Technologies: Written using JavaScript, CSS and HTML!

### Next Steps
* Better Tracking when snake hit itself
* Improved styling for responsive design
* More detailed graphic of worm
